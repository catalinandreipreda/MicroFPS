## About
A collection of 5 photoscanned PBR materials. All textures are 2048x2048 resolution (2k). All materials tile seamlessly. All textures are fully compatible with a variety of different scenarios - Unity terrain, Unity BIRP Standard Shader, URP Standard Shader, HDRP Standard Shader, and much more are compatible.

All of the below maps are included for each material:
Base Color
Height
Metallic (R), Smoothness (A)
Normal
Occlusion

Each material is pre-configured and designed to work out-of-the-box for URP.

HDRP: You can re-bake the Occlusion map into the Metallic/Smoothness Mask to create the Mask map for HDRP.
