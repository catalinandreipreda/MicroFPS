# Galactic Fury

"Galactic Fury" is a high-octane first-person shooter set in a dystopian future, drawing inspiration from classic arcade games like "Doom" and "Unreal Tournament." Players embark on a mission to confront a rogue AI, Anton, which controls Echelon, a militaristic outpost filled with AI-controlled robots. The game unfolds on a distant alien world, featuring a rocky terrain with lava rivers orbiting a Saturn-like planet. Players, assuming the role of David Bowman, a top space marine and the sole human survivor on Echelon, face intense combat against waves of robotic enemies. The gameplay emphasizes fast aiming, agile movement, and strategic weapon use, set against visually stunning environments

# Gameplay

The game is a fast-paced arcade style FPS which draws inspiration from games like Doom. Levels are intentionally challenging – dying and replaying the level, each time learning from your past mistakes, learning the enemies, the weapons and the layout is all part of the process. Each playable scene is small enough so repeating the level is easy to do and a checkpoint system is not required.

# Primary Elements

- Robotic Opponents: The game introduces two distinct robotic enemies:
  - Hovering Robots: Agile and equipped with laser guns, these robots patrol specific areas and actively pursue the player if alerted.
  - Static Turrets: Large, stationary units armed with powerful laser cannons, positioned strategically to guard key objectives.
This enemy set is minimalistic but still allows for engaging level design: the large turrets are a big threat with their heavy fire and armour, but combined with the agile Hoverbots, the level forces players to be constantly moving, dodging shots and firing at multiple targets on the move.
- Weaponry: Players begin with a standard laser blaster, capable of rapid-fire with moderate damage.
  Additional weapons you can find as pickups or enemy loot:
  - Plasma Launcher: Can either stun or displace smaller enemies, offering versatility in combat. It can do a quick attack or a charged shot by holding the trigger before releasing.
  - Particle Shotgun: Deals high damage but requires reloading after shooting resulting in lower fire rate.

All the weapons have ammo that gets depleted as you shoot. When you are out of ammo, you need to let the weapon cooldown and recharge so timing your attacks and effectively cycling trough your weapons become crucial when dealing with multiple enemies. Judging which weapon is best to take out a type of enemy or a group of enemies in different situations is also an important part of the gameplay.
